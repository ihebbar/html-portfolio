<h3>Zindagi na milegi dobara</h3>

This is a movie about three friends who go on a trip. <br />
They learn a lot about themselves and about the world. <br />
My rating: 10/10 (breaks my scale)

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>

<p>
    Again a movie about three friends lol. <br />
    But this time they are in school figuring out what they want to do with life <br />
    This movie is a rollercoster of emotions. <br />
    It holds a special place in my heart. <br />
    My rating: 101001/10

<h3>Mean girls</h3>

<p>
    Ok I'm sensing a pattern now. <br />

    MEAN FRIENDS who get a fourth friend who changes the entire dynamic. <br />
    My rating: 9.99/10 (good but can't comapre to the previous ones.)
